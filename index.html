        Today I learned how to code a website on cloud9.
        The code we used was html to help people see our website.

         This week I learned how to use Tinkercad.
         I started my rube goldberg machine on tinkercad. 
         We had a competetion on tinkercad on who can make the most identical home appliances.
         We were learning about simple machines to include in our tinkercade on the rube goldberg machine.

         I continued to work on tinkercad to make our Rube Goldberg machine.
         We got into groups and combined our machines to create the greatest machine.
         I also updated and made a couple of changes on my website.

         This week we started building our rube goldberg machine and did a paper boat challenge on thursday.
         The rube golberg machine has been very time consuming due to working with no tape and carboard.
         Although it has been very fun making the machine with my group and we have been making progress.
         The paper boat challenge was a fun challenge where we made paper boats and had to put the heaviest 
         object on it while floating in water.
         I'm excited to see the finsh product of my rube goldberg machine next week.
         In addition to the new challenge we will be doing next week.

 We didn't do much this week. We built our design on tinkercad.
 We designed our prostethic legs for our animals that we chose. 
 Then we answered a couple of questions given to us about our prostethics.

This week we started to get into computer engineering.
We began to take apart laptops and take a look at where the parts are.
We labeled a layout of a laptop with all the parts and components in the laptop.

 This week we have been learning about areospace engineering.
 We went over slides on how aircrafts work and how they manage to stay in the air.
 We learned vocabulary on how the aircraft moves up, down, left, and down.
 The challenge this week was to see who will get the closest to a bin with a aircraft made from paper.
 We have been designing a bottle rocket to get threw the field goal and make it go as far as possible.

 This week we were building our Bom's and trying to learn more about areospace engineering.
 We used all the materials given to us to make a rocket that goes as far as possible.
 We first brainstormed ideas with our groups until we started building our porjects.
 My project was very colorful and bright making it look amazing in the sky.
 All in all this week was a fun week making our projects.

 This week we started learning about electrical engineering.
 This section of engineering will take us 3 weeks of lectures and activities.
 I really enjoyed learning about electrical engineering this week.
 We started to work on bread board circuits.
 The bread boards were on tinkercad and we followed a google classroom slide presentation.

This week we have been working on our breadboards.
We started to use our cuircuts we practiced on tinkercad in person now.
We followed a google slide presentation to work on getting energy to the led lights.
Then we used multimeters to find the voltage and resistance values.
Our challenge for the week was to try and persuade our perfessor what would be better to do from 
writing one to a million or take a math course.

 This week we worked on programming arduino boards.
 We worked with many different cuircuts. 
 I enjoyed working on the cuircuts with my fellow partner.
 We worked together to get the cuircuts to work in the pattern given to us.
 Although I wasn't here to do the challenge of the week due to illnesses.

 This week we began to learn about civil engineering on monday with a slide show.
 Then we were introduced to a new project for our final.
 Our final is to make a bridge out of speghetti using only 20 noodles.
 We will have to carry a bucket of water and try and hold the most amount of water weight.
 We began to glue our first design we came up wuth.

 Last semseter we ended off by making a bridge out of speghetti to hold as much weight as possible.
 We were limited to only 20 noodles in this civil engineering project.
 After the semester was done we had winter break for 2 and a half weeks.
 In that time I spent time with my family and friends.
 We went out many times making great memories and having fun over the holidays.
 In this week we learned how to market engineering. We watched a video of sharktank giving us an example of how to
 negotiate buisnesses. After we began to start our own buisness presentation to offer our teacher.
 We will have to convince him that our buisness is worth the money we thinks its worth.
