         This week I learned how to use Tinkercad.
         I started my rube goldberg machine on tinkercad. 
         We had a competetion on tinkercad on who can make the most identical home appliances.
         We were learning about simple machines to include in our tinkercade on the rube goldberg machine.

         I continued to work on tinkercad to make our Rube Goldberg machine.
         We got into groups and combined our machines to create the greatest machine.
         I also updated and made a couple of changes on my website.

         This week we started building our rube goldberg machine and did a paper boat challenge on thursday.
         The rube golberg machine has been very time consuming due to working with no tape and carboard.
         Although it has been very fun making the machine with my group and we have been making progress.
         The paper boat challenge was a fun challenge where we made paper boats and had to put the heaviest 
         object on it while floating in water.
         I'm excited to see the finsh product of my rube goldberg machine next week.
         In addition to the new challenge we will be doing next week.

 We didn't do much this week. We built our design on tinkercad.
 We designed our prostethic legs for our animals that we chose. 
 Then we answered a couple of questions given to us about our prostethics.

 This week we have been learning about areospace engineering.
 We went over slides on how aircrafts work and how they manage to stay in the air.
 We learned vocabulary on how the aircraft moves up, down, left, and down.
 The challenge this week was to see who will get the closest to a bin with a aircraft made from paper.
 We have been designing a bottle rocket to get threw the field goal and make it go as far as possible.

 This week we were building our Bom's and trying to learn more about areospace engineering.
 We used all the materials given to us to make a rocket that goes as far as possible.
 We first brainstormed ideas with our groups until we started building our porjects.
 My project was very colorful and bright making it look amazing in the sky.
 All in all this week was a fun week making our projects.

 This week we started learning about electrical engineering.
 This section of engineering will take us 3 weeks of lectures and activities.
 I really enjoyed learning about electrical engineering this week.
 We started to work on bread board circuits.
 The bread boards were on tinkercad and we followed a google classroom slide presentation.

This week we have been working on our breadboards.
We started to use our cuircuts we practiced on tinkercad in person now.
We followed a google slide presentation to work on getting energy to the led lights.
Then we used multimeters to find the voltage and resistance values.
Our challenge for the week was to try and persuade our perfessor what would be better to do from 
writing one to a million or take a math course.

 This week we worked on programming arduino boards.
 We worked with many different cuircuts. 
 I enjoyed working on the cuircuts with my fellow partner.
 We worked together to get the cuircuts to work in the pattern given to us.
 Although I wasn't here to do the challenge of the week due to illnesses.

 This week we began to learn about civil engineering on monday with a slide show.
 Then we were introduced to a new project for our final.
 Our final is to make a bridge out of speghetti using only 20 noodles.
 We will have to carry a bucket of water and try and hold the most amount of water weight.
 We began to glue our first design we came up wuth.

 Last semseter we ended off by making a bridge out of speghetti to hold as much weight as possible.
 We were limited to only 20 noodles in this civil engineering project.
 After the semester was done we had winter break for 2 and a half weeks.
 In that time I spent time with my family and friends.
 We went out many times making great memories and having fun over the holidays.
 In this week we learned how to market engineering. We watched a video of sharktank giving us an example of how to
 negotiate buisnesses. After we began to start our own buisness presentation to offer our teacher.
 We will have to convince him that our buisness is worth the money we thinks its worth.

 This week we learned how to presentate our buisness ideas to other.
 We tried to persuade them to make offers on our buisness.
 In addition to making offers for other buisnesses.
 I now have a portion of 2 other buisnesses due to having the winning offer.

 This week we learned about viscosity is a measure of its resistance to deformation at a given rate of a certain fluid.
 Going more into viscosity we made oobleck which is a great example of viscosity.
 In addition to trying to make a House of Cards as tall as we can in small groups of 4.
 Our project is to make a mousetrap car that goes the farthest distance.

 Our design is very thought out from both Geghard and I.
 We asked many questions to Professor Poole to make sure our design was ready for building.
 It is a three wheel moustrap car designed to go as far as possible.
 The challenge we did this week was builidng a bridge as long as we can with post-it notes.
 My bridge was very sturdy rather than long due to not understanding the rules at first.

 This week worked on making our designs into life.
 My partner and I tried making a ruft draft of the project with the materials provided at the time.
 We made two different drafts on which we will improve.
 During challenge day we worked on making a triangular hole to allow the waterballoon to get in it.

 This week we continued to make our project.
 We cut up the base of our moustrap car using cardboard.
 In addition to adding the discs which act as the wheels of the car.
 We used skewers to use as an axle for the discs. 
 We also added the mousetrap and with the string to the axle.

 This week we worked on finishing our project.
 We finished and the project worked perfectly.
 But we wanted to make it have better performance so we started to work on making it better.
 We changed the string to fishing net to make it lighter and to make it move more freely.
 We are going to finish our project by trying to see what we can improve on.

 Our mousetrap car didn't do the best.
 This was because of the cricket axl in the front of the car.
 We worked on finalizing our projects to make sure they were ready for the race.
 I learned from this project that making a DIY mousetrap car takes many different sections to work on to perfect.
 I also learned how to make a proposal for equipment when asking to make something.

  We've been working on our tinketcad for our final.
  The boat design is very simple and calculated to stay afloat.
  Our sizing is great due to being able to fit both Geghard and Austin.
  We made sure our boat will only need the one roll of ductape we are provided.

  This week my group and I have made more progress on our boat final.
  We started building the physical boat based off the tinkercad.
  We seperated into two groups of two.
  One group worked on the base of the boat and the other worked on the walls of the group.

  This week we made more progress to the base and in fact finished it.
  We made sure it was exact to the tinkercad.
  We also started working on our walls for the boat.
  We started by measuring and cutting out the parts for the walls.

     This week we started making parts for our walls.
     We cut holes to slip in our supporting walls in.
     In addition to ductaping the walls together.
     The two side walls are cut out and ready to be taped to the base.

     We added some of the walls but they fell down leading to us to work on it a bit more.
     Then we worked on the paper roller coaster on challenge day to end off the week.

     We worked on the walls to finish the boat. 
     This week was our last week of working on the boat so we made sure to work extra hard.
     We ended up finishing and having in my opinion one of the best boats in the class.

     We first started the day by taking the boats to the pool.
     When we got to the pool we started to watch others attempt on the testing.
     When we had our turn we realized the walls were too high and we weren't able to paddle.
