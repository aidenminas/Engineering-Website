        The code we used was html to help people see our website.

         This week I learned how to use Tinkercad.
         I started my rube goldberg machine on tinkercad. 
         We had a competetion on tinkercad on who can make the most identical home appliances.
         We were learning about simple machines to include in our tinkercade on the rube goldberg machine.

         I continued to work on tinkercad to make our Rube Goldberg machine.
         We got into groups and combined our machines to create the greatest machine.
         I also updated and made a couple of changes on my website.

         This week we started building our rube goldberg machine and did a paper boat challenge on thursday.
         The rube golberg machine has been very time consuming due to working with no tape and carboard.
         Although it has been very fun making the machine with my group and we have been making progress.
         The paper boat challenge was a fun challenge where we made paper boats and had to put the heaviest 
         object on it while floating in water.
